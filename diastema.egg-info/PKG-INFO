        Diastema: Musical intervals and modality analysis
        =================================================
        
        Overview
        ========
        
        **Diastema**, is a project to analyse musical modality. It uses Python2.
        
        For now, it's main features are :
        
        * Fondamental frequencies extraction (using *PredominentMelody()* from **Essentia**);
        * Getting the main frequencies as peaks of the probability density function from frequencies;
        * Comparing PDFs using a correlation coefficient;
        * Getting a similarity matrix between melodies.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        First, you need to install manually **Essentia** (http://essentia.upf.edu/).
        
        Then, install Diastema with the following :
        
        .. code:: python
        	
        	pip install diastema
        
        Or :
        
        .. code:: python
        
        	git clone https://github.com/AnasGhrab/diastema
        	python setup.py install
        
        
        Basic Usage
        =====
        
        To use Diastema :
        
        .. code:: python
        
        	from diastema import *
        	path = "path/to/a/folder/with/audios/wav/files/"
        	Music = Melodies(path)
        	
        Then you can
        
        .. code:: python
        
        	Music.PdfsPlot()
        	Music.Simatrix()
